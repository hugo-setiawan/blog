Hi! This is the personal blog of [Hugo Sulaiman Setiawan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-setiawan/), a third year Computer Science major at the [Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia](https://cs.ui.ac.id).

This blog will mostly be filled with random observations and knowledge that I might want to note and share. Currently, I have a keen interest in computer networks, server administration/DevOps, as well as financial technology. Consequently, you can expect this blog to predominantly focus on these subjects (although this doesn't preclude myself from discussing anything else).

Please bear in mind that the writings and opinions shared here are solely my own thoughts and do not represent the perspectives of my educational institution nor of any other entity.
